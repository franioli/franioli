I am a Post-Doc in the [Remote Sensing of Environmental Changes (RSE)](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/rse.html) Group in the Department of Geography at the University of Zurich.  
My work focuses on photogrammetry and SfM for glacier monitoring. 

Previously, I got a PhD in geomatics at [LabMGF](https://labmgf.dica.polimi.it/) at Politecnico di Milano.

I am developing [ICEpy4D](https://github.com/franioli/ICEpy4D), a python package for performing 4D monitoring of an alpine glacier by using low-cost stereo cameras, Deep Learning and photogrammetry, and I am contributing to [Deep-Image-Matching](https://github.com/3DOM-FBK/deep-image-matching), a multiview matching library with deep-learning and hand-crafted local features for COLMAP and other SfM software. 
I also work on integration of UAV photogrammetry, Terrestrial Laser Scanning and topographic techniques for structural health assessment, with a particular fP

I am a UAV pilot, licensed to operate in critical scenarios.
