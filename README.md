I am a PhD student in Environmental and Infrastructure Engineer, and I am specialized in geomatics, photogrammetry, topography and GIS. 
My work focuses on UAV photogrammetry for land, glacier and infrastructure monitoring, as well as on integration of photogrammetry, laser scanner and topographic techniques for 3D modelling.
I am a UAV pilot, licensed to operate in critical scenarios.
