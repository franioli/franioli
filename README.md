I am a PhD student in Geomatics. 
My work focuses on photogrammetry and SfM for glacier monitoring. 

I am developing [ICEpy4D](https://github.com/franioli/ICEpy4D), a python package for performing 4D monitoring of an alpine glacier by using low-cost stereo cameras, Deep Learning and photogrammetry. 

I also work on integration of UAV photogrammetry, Terrestrial Laser Scanning and topographic techniques for structural health assessment, with a particular focus on cracks and damages detection on concrete bridges. 

I am a UAV pilot, licensed to operate in critical scenarios.
